# EasyWay---Online-Cab-Booking-Platform
A prototype of an online cab booking platform which would draw results from different cab booking applications.

Problem Statement-
There are many different applications that provide the same functionality of booking cabs and autorickshaws for commuting which causes many kinds of problems to users like many times different applications showing different fares for travelling to the same place from the same location. Like if you book a cab for travelling from IIITD to Hauz Khas, then Ola may charge you Rs.180, whereas Uber may charge you Rs.150 for the same route. Also, the response time and arrival time of your transport is different for different applications. Like if you book a cab from Ola, it might come in 10 minutes, and if you book a cab from Uber, it might come within 5 minutes, which makes a difference to the users as it wastes their time waiting for the cab. Manual comparison between different apps is a challenging and time taking process.

Ideation and Low-Fidelity Prototyping-
The best solution that we found is making an app that would serve the purpose of drawing a comparison between different apps in a single platform. We have prototyped an app named EasyWay which would draw a comparison on different bases like charges of the cab, reviews from the past customers, time taken by the cab to reach the location, mode of payment available. It will also include the feature to cancel the cab after booking.
